# Cat-DogClassificationUsingKerasCNN


Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are everywhere. It is arguably the most popular deep learning architecture. The main advantage of CNN compared to its predecessors is that it automatically detects the important features without any human supervision. For example, given many pictures of cats and dogs it learns distinctive features for each class by itself.

CNN is also computationally efficient. It uses special convolution and pooling operations and performs parameter sharing. This enables CNN models to run on any device, making them universally attractive.
